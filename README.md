# CLI-team-fighting-game
This is a CLI based team fighting game. 
This was a class project at Oregon State University. It utilizes OOP principles to link header files and source files together that make the game. Linked lists were implemented manually as the specifications forbade using the standard library.

To run, use make, which will build the binary and run in the terminal. The makefile also has a debug command which utilizes valgrind to check for leaks.
